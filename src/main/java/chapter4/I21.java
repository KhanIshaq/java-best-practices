 *
 *Many new default methods were added to the core collection interfaces in Java 8, primarily to facilitate the use of lambdas
 *
 *The Java librariesâ€™ default methods are high-quality general-purpose implementations, and in most cases, they work fine
 *
 *But it is not always possible to write a default method that maintains all invariants of every conceivable implementation.
 *
 *Even though default methods are now a part of the Java platform, it is still of the utmost importance to design interfaces with great care.
 *
 * If an interface contains a minor flaw, it may irritate its users forever; if an interface is severely deficient, it may doom the API that contains it.
 * 
 * While it may be possible to correct some interface flaws after an interface is released, you cannot count on it.
 * 
 * At a minimum, you should aim for three diverse implementations.
